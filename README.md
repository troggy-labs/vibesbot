# VibesBot ðŸŽµ

A Slack bot that transforms fuzzy feelings into curated playlists using AI-powered text parsing and Spotify's music catalog.

## What it does

VibesBot takes free-form descriptions of moods and moments and creates personalized playlists:

- **"sad indie coffee-shop at 2 a.m."** â†’ A melancholy playlist with sparse indie tracks
- **"Friday wind-down after a long week"** â†’ Chill, relaxing tunes perfect for unwinding
- **"Monday morning motivation"** â†’ Upbeat tracks to power through the day

## Features

### ðŸ§  Smart Text Parsing
Uses OpenAI to convert vague descriptions into precise music parameters:
- Mood analysis (melancholy, energetic, chill)
- Genre identification (indie, rock, electronic, etc.)
- Energy levels, tempo, and emotional valence

### ðŸŽ¯ Context Awareness
Enriches recommendations with:
- Current day of week and time
- User's recent Slack messages for additional context
- Makes playlists feel "psychic" without extra input

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Enhancement
- Generates custom DALL-E cover art for each playlist
- Creative playlist names and descriptions
- Professional presentation in Slack

### ðŸŽµ Intelligent Curation
- Sources music from Spotify's vast catalog
- Orders tracks to tell a "story" (slow â†’ upbeat)
- Filters and scores tracks based on mood matching
